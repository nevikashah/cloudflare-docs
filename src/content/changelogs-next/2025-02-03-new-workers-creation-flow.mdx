![New Workers Creation Flow](~/assets/images/workers/new-workers-creation-flow.png)

When getting started with Workers, you can now kickstart your development workflow by: 
* **Importing a Git repository**: Choose an existing Git repo on your GitHub/GitLab account and set up [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/) 
* **Deploying a template with Git**: Choose from a selection of full stack, production ready [examples](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates). When you're ready to deploy, let Cloudflare create a Git repository and provision any required [resources](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). 

With any commit to your Git repository, Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy your Worker, letting you iterate more quickly on your application.

To get started, click the `Create` button on the [Workers dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create).
