![New Workers Creation Flow](~/assets/images/workers/new-workers-creation-flow.png)

When getting started with Workers, you can now kickstart your development workflow by: 
* **Importing a Git repository**: Choose an existing Git repo on your GitHub/GitLab account and set up [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/) to deploy your Worker. 
* **Deploying a template with Git**: Choose from a brand new selection of production ready [examples](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates) to help you get started with popular frameworks like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/) or build stateful applications with Cloudflare resources like [D1 databases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) or [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)! When you're ready to deploy, Cloudflare will set up your project by creating a Git repository, provisioning any required [resources](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) and deploying your Worker. 

With any new commit to your Git repository, Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy your Worker, letting you iterate more quickly on your application.

To get started, click the `Create` button on the [Workers dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create). While these new features are only rolled out to a subset of users to start, you can opt in to enable these new features on your account now by filling out this [form](https://forms.gle/U1qhkF2snNJDGJJa9)
