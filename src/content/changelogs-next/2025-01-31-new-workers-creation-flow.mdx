![New Workers Creation Flow](~/assets/images/workers/new-workers-creation-flow.png)

We're making it even easier to get started with Cloudflare Workers. You can now kickstart your development workflow by: 
* **Importing a Git repository**: You can choose an existing Git repo on your Github/Gitlab account and configure your [Workers Builds settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/) 
* **Deploying a template with Git**: Choose from a selection of full stack, production ready [examples](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates) and seamlessly set up a Git repository for a continuous build and deployment workflow

To get started, click the `Create` on the [Workers dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create).
